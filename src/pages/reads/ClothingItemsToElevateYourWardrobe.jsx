                <p>We all know that work weeks are usually filled with working round the clock: meeting deadlines, attending conferences and finalising projects. Amidst all these, trying to keep up with your social and having a significant presence in your family life, it can be very easy for you to either overlook the importance of dressing in your place of work, or underdress due to the lack of time to pick clothing items that make you more confident and feel more powerful.</p>

                <p>However, here is a piece of good news: you do not have to spend a lot of time or have an endless amount of clothes to create new looks that match your personality at work! The secret is to have the basics of outfits for your work, and a formula that keeps you from repeating the same dreary styles day in day out be it mixing jackets with suits or playing with tailored proportions.</p>

                <p>Gentlemen's Crib is here to take you through a discovery of ten outfits to take your busiest days in effortless style.</p>

                <h3>1. A Dark-Coloured Two-Piece Suit</h3>

                        <p>A traditional two-piece suit, preferably of a darker shade (for starters), is a necessity in every man's closet. Darker shades such as black, navy blue or dark grey, are preferable to their lighter counterparts because they serve as the foundation for professional looks and can be paired with more clothing items.</p>
                        
                        <p>Although lighter and bolder colours of suits can be acquired with time to give your closet more vibrance and increase your options, they are not considered one of the basics. </p>

                <h3>2. White Shirts</h3>

                    <PostPhotoElaborate>
                        <p>Just like a two-piece suit, white shirts are a necessity for every man because of their versatility and classy touch. Besides being perfect with suits of any colour, white shirts also contribute with business casuals because they can be worn with a pair of jeans, bow tie and even suspenders. It is for these reasons that white shirts are basics you must own. </p>

                <h3>3. Coloured Shirts</h3>

                        <p>Although white shirts are more versatile than their coloured counterparts, coloured Shirts are also basics that are necessary in coming up with a dressing formula for your place of work. </p>

                        <p>When we say coloured Shirts, we do not only mean solid colours but also patterns and multicoloured shirts. While white shirts give off an aura of elegance, coloured shirts give off a vibe of creativity and boldness and can be paired with suits too. </p>

                <h3>4. Waistcoats </h3>
                <PostPhotoWrapContainer>
                    <PostPhotoElaborate>
                        <p>It is a wonder that most men do not own a waistcoat as it is one of the most versatile pieces of cloth a gentleman can have. Waistcoats are slimming and distinctive. They can also highlight your tie if you decide to wear one, and have the potential of making business casual outfits sharper and more professional.</p>
                        
                        <p>Since waistcoats are not cloth pieces you will wear often, it will not hurt to indulge yourself with slightly extravagant ones.  </p>
                        
                        <h4>Tips To Note Before Wearing a Waistcoat</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>It is always a good idea to match the colour of your waistcoat with that of your trousers. If you can't, opt for trousers of neutral colours like black.</li>
                            <li>Always fasten the buttons of your waistcoat.</li>
                            <li>Iron or dewrinkle your waistcoat before wearing. </li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>5. Black Trousers </h3>
                <p>The importance of adding black trousers to your closet as one of its basics can not be overemphasized. They are the most adaptable pairs to own as a result of their neutral colour and one of the safest colours to flaunt too. They match well with other colours, outfits and designs. It is safe to say that we cannot get by without black trousers and if you do not already own one, at least, it is high time you did. </p>

                <h3>6. Dark Jeans</h3>
                <p>Coupled with a pair of black trousers, a pair of black jeans is a basic clothing item you should add to your wardrobe. The choice of shirts and shoes that go with dark jeans are endless. Dark jeans also allow you to style your outfit how you want to: either tuck in your shirt or let it hang loose over your waist. </p>

                <h3>7. Black Leather Shoes</h3>

                    <PostPhotoElaborate>
                        <p>When you go shopping for your work outfit essentials, it is important that you throw in a black pair of leather shoes preferably toe rounded and skimpy contoured. The reason for these specifications is because, first of all, black is a colour that goes well with every other colour, and a toe rounded shoe works fabulously well with both jeans and trousers. Match your pair of shoes with a conservative pair of socks and your work outfits are beginning to turn out right. </p>

                <h3>8. Leather Belt</h3>
                <p>If your choice of clothes so far have been great, something as simple as a leather belt will make it better. When picking a leather belt, you should opt for one that's the same shade as your pair of shoes. As we've agreed that black is a neutral colour and black shoes can work almost every time, you should also get black leather belts. Other neutral colours with almost as much versatility as black are brown and grey.</p>


                <h3>9. A Tie</h3>
                <p>One of the ways to create a strong statement you can take pride in is to wear a tie. There are thousands of ways of matching ties with outfits. When picking ties, you should go for ones with lengths and widths that you are both comfortable with and match your body shape and height. </p>

                <h3>10. A wristwatch</h3>
                <PostPhotoWrapContainer>
                    <PostPhotoElaborate>
                        <p>There aren't many rules when picking a wristwatch. Basically, go with a wristwatch that matches your personality. If you would rather go for a digital wristwatch, there's no harm in it. And if you want a small analogue too, you are on point. You can also go from minimalistic and simple styles to vintage or classical ones. The important thing is that you do not pass on this very personal aesthetic. </p>
