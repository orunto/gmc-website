                <p>Most corporate offices these days have, thankfully, toned down their business outfit standards which used to be rigid, monotonous and dreary: the good old suit, a plain necktie and black, or on special occasions, brown loafers.</p>

                <p>Most corporate offices these days have, thankfully, toned down their business outfit standards which used to be rigid, monotonous and dreary: the good old suit, a plain necktie and black, or on special occasions, brown loafers.</p>

                <p>If you are one of these men that can do with a little help, do not panic because Gentlemen’s Crib has your back and will guide you through the somewhat ambiguous men's fashion world till you find your ground and own boss-level blazers and deal-closing pairs of footwear to make both you and those you come in contact with feel great about you.</p>

                <h2>What are Business Casuals?</h2>
                <p>This is probably the first question that crossed your mind the moment you set your eyes on this article. In simple terms, Business Casuals are outfits you wear to work that are considered less formal than the traditional business wears but still give a businesslike impression. Reasons, why business Casuals are gaining more acceptance today, are because:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>You can make adjustments to your outfits to suit weather conditions as well as other variables. Imagine the terror of wearing a suit for a 7-hour job every day during the dry season with a tie clung to your neck!</li>
                    <li>You can express your styles better, stand out, and quit being invisible from every Tom, Dick and Harry you work with.</li>
                </ul>

                        <p>Your business casual shirt is what sets the tone for the rest of your outfit, which means it is a part you can't afford to get wrong at any time. For a perfectly balanced business casual wardrobe, factors to consider when purchasing Business Casual Shirts are:</p>

                </PostPhotoWrapContainer>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Shape</h4>
                        <p>Business Casual Shirts are meant to fit you just right. That is, neither be too big, making it look like you're ‘swimming’ in your shirt nor skin tight so that breathing becomes difficult.</p>

                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Separate Before you Wash</h4>
                        <p>One major difference between business casual shirts and casual shirts is their different hem lengths. Business Casual Shirts should be tucked in at all times, unlike casual shirts, and hence, should have a longer hem to ensure that they are neatly tucked.</p>
                        <p>If you intend on dressing to impress, but you don't want to go fully formal, throw on a blazer and tie to polish your look. </p>

                    </li>
                </ul>
                
                <h4>Do's And Don'ts of Business Casual Shirts</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Don't wear a suit jacket that's too fancy because it defeats the purpose of being worn to your place of work.</li>
                    <li>Don't wear a baggy sweater, if you must at all (due to the weather).</li>
                    <li>Don't wear shorts, brightly coloured or multi-coloured shirts with lousy patterns.</li>
                    <li>Do wear a tailored blazer made of high quality.</li>
                    <li>Do wear a tight-fitting sweater with a collared shirt underneath.</li>
                    <li>Do wear neutral and monochromatic colours.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Business Casual Men Trousers</h3>

                    <PostPhotoElaborate>
                        <p>Trousers are an important part of your business casual outfit because the interaction between your top half and bottom half either make or break your outfit. </p>
                        <p>Examples of such business casual trousers include but are not limited to Chinos Trousers, Khakis, and Corduroy. These will be discussed briefly.</p>

                <h4>Chinos Trousers </h4>
                <p>Chinos, which were initially standard-issue army trousers, have gradually been incorporated into what is accepted in workspaces. They have a more streamlined appearance than their counterparts such as Khakis, and come in a wider range of colours too.</p>
                <p>For men who do not want to spend too much time on aesthetics, Chinos are a great choice because they go well with most business casuals.</p>

                <h4>Khakis</h4>
                <p>Unlike Chinos, Khaki is a colour, rather than a type of business casual trouser. They are a shade of light brown that became more accepted after the second world war. </p>
                <p>In their simplicity, Khakis remain a reliable template to project your business casual styles on.</p>

                <h4>Corduroy Trousers</h4>
                <p>Corduroy trousers go well with t-shirts, denim jackets and more, making them a great fashion tool for your business casuals. Corduroy trousers are made of threads woven together in diagonal lines, and tend to be both thick, durable and comfortable. </p>
                

                <h3>Business Casual Shoes</h3>

                    <PostPhotoElaborate>
                        <p>Getting through work in the right shoes, day after day, week after week, is very tricky, and must be handled with the utmost care, because, by picking the wrong pair of shoes to go with your business casual outfits, you can undo all the hard work you've done piecing your clothes together.</p>
                
                        <p>Gentlemen's Crib understands this and has your best interest at heart. That is why we have curated a list of business casual shoes for thorough guidance. At the top of our list for business casual shoes include:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Loafers</h4>
                        <p>If you do not already have a pair of loafers, it is time to add a few to your collection.</p>
                        <p>What are loafers?</p>
                        <p>Loafers are the slip-on shoes of the modern man that have slowly made their way into workspaces as business casual shoes. </p>
                        <p>To play it safe, your best option are brown or black loafers (with a matching belt to polish your look).</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Monk straps</h4>
                        <p>Monk straps are differentiated from other shoes by one or two leather straps and buckles instead of conventional laces. Their sophisticated design makes them appropriate to be worn to your place of work, weekend events and after-work drinks.</p>
                        <p>When purchasing monk straps, we suggest opting for one with shiny leather.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Oxfords</h4>
                        <p>The mistake many men make with Oxfords is thinking they can only be worn formally. This is not true. When styled correctly, oxfords are very versatile and can pass as business casual footwear too. </p>
                        <p>However, as business casuals, you have to avoid Oxfords with patent designs. If you still feel a little too formal with an Oxford, check out the next on our list.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Derby Shoes</h4>
                        <p>Thanks to their minimal design, Derby Shoes are very versatile. They go with formal outfits just as much as they do for business casuals and are a must in every man's wardrobe. </p>
                        <p>We, at Gentlemen's Crib, hope this guide gives you a basic understanding of the outfits you need to build your work outfit wardrobe to inject more life into your work. Good luck out there, gentlemen.</p>
