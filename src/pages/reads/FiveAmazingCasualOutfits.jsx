                <p>Casual is what most people will call their style and it's also how most people will dress most of the time. Casual style is very comfortable and can easily be done. Unfortunately, casual is usually an excuse for some people not to put effort in their dress and end up dressing terribly. I am sure you have observed it as well, everyone wears the same low effort style and calls it casual.</p>
                <p>In this article, I'll be sharing with you, five casual outfits you should consider adding to your style portfolio today. </p>

                <h3>Outfit #1: Shorts, A Tee shirt and White Sneakers</h3>
                <p>The first outfit you should try involves shorts. Slim well fitting shorts. To nail this look, fit is very very important. The shorts should sit about an inch or two above the knee (avoid cargo shorts). A solid coloured tee shirt or polo will work well for this look as well as simple sneakers like vans or Chuck Taylors. Accessories will elevate this outfit.</p>
                <p>This outfit is great for the beach and a picnic.</p>

                <h3>Outfit #2: Long sleeve tee shirt with smart pants</h3>
                <p>The first outfit you should try involves shorts. Slim well fitting shorts. To nail this look, fit is very very important.

                <h3>Outfit #3: Hoodie and a brown overcoat</h3>
                <p>You know I can't make a list of casual outfits without mentioning the hoodie. The hoodie is the MVP of casual clothing. The hoodie can be worn in a lot of ways you can check here for different ways to style the hoodie.</p>

                <h3>Outfit #4: Polo shirt and dress pants</h3>
                <p>This outfit is built with the polo shirt as its base. Polo shirts in simple colours are very versatile and are the dressier version of the tee shirt. The polo shirt can be matched with smart trousers, chino trousers or chino shorts. For your shoes, you should stick with dress shoes or simple sneakers.</p>

                <h3>Outfit #5: Business casual</h3>
                <p>The final outfit is what a lot of people will call business casual. It's the type of outfit you wear when your boss invites you for a sunday dinner. This outfit is a dressed down version of the suit. Remove your tie, let loose a few buttons and you're good. If you want, you can swap your Oxford shirt for a tee shirt and your dress shoes for a pair of sneakers to add a smart casual twist.</p>

                <p>These five outfits give you more options to add to your style portfolio, and as you can see you don't need extremely branded or designer items to stand out with your style the proper basics can go a long way.</p>
