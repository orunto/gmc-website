                <p>Smell is one of the primal ways humans gather information. Smell is a way people can evaluate things like food, environments and also people.

In this article, you will learn the essentials about fragrances, the different types, how to apply fragrances correctly and many more.</p>

                <h2>A Man's Complete Guide to Fragrances </h2>
                <p>Before we get in deep, we need to know what fragrances are. The simple definition of a fragrance is a mixture of concentrated perfume oil and a solvent (usually alcohol), usually in liquid form and gives off a good scent. The primary purpose of fragrance is to project a pleasant scent from the wearer.</p>
                <p>Before we continue, I want to clarify something: if it's from a can, it is not categorised as fragrance, so axe body spray and Nivea deodorant aren't fragrances. They may smell nice but aren't classified as fragrances.</p>

                <h3>Types of Fragrances</h3>

                        <p>Fragrances are usually classified into five groups based on the concentration of the perfume oil in the solution.</p>
                        
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <h4>Parfum</h4>
                                <p>A parfum is a type of fragrance with a concentration of 20-30%. Fragrances in this category have the highest perfume oil concentration and often last the longest, between 8-24 hours.</p>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </PostPhotoElaborate>
                </PostPhotoWrapContainer>
                <ul>

                        <h4>Eau de Parfum</h4>
                        <p>Eau de Parfum Fragrances have a 15-20% concentration of perfume oil. The scent lasts 4-5 hours.</p>

                <h3>How to Choose The Right Fragrance</h3>
                <PostPhotoWrapContainer>
                    <PostPhotoElaborate>
                        <p>Selecting a fragrance is a personal and different journey for everyone. <b>The best person to choose a fragrance for you is yourself.</b> While you should be open to people's suggestions and consider them, the ultimate decision should be yours. If other people believe that a fragrance is great but you don't like it, don't use it. Your fragrance should make you feel good effortlessly. It should boost your confidence, not make you unsure of yourself.</p>
                        <p>You should understand that fragrances would work differently on different people but good fragrances will generally work well with most people (so be open to recommendations).</p>
                        <p>If you have the opportunity, test a fragrance before buying it. Some stores allow customers to try scents. If you want to test fragrance, you should spray it on your wrist (you can test two fragrances on both wrists), perceive the smell, go about other activities and observe how the smell changes as time pass. <b>This way you can smell the different notes of the fragrance.</b></p>

                <h3>The Lifecycle of Fragrances.</h3>
                <p>The life-cycle of a fragrance refers to the three notes of the fragrance that can be perceived as time passes.</p>
                <p><b>What are Notes?</b> Notes are the district scents that fragrance gives off at different times and combine to give the fragrance its scent. There are three types of notes, the top note, the middle/heart note and the base note.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The top note is the light scent that can be perceived immediately when the fragrance has been applied to the skin.</li>
                    <li>The middle/heart note is the note that can be perceived after the top note. It is the main element of the fragrance.</li>
                    <li>The base note is the bold scent that is noticeable later in the day. The base note usually determines how long the fragrance will last.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>How to Apply Fragrance Correctly </h3>

                        <p>As you go about your day-to-day, chances are that you would have come across people whose scent gives you a headache. These people don't have the knowledge on how to apply fragrances properly and so apply too much, becoming a nuisance to others.</p>
                        <p>We don't want you to be one of those people and so we will give you the information you need.</p>
                        <p>The first (and maybe most important) thing you need to know is that less is more. Don't overuse your fragrance. Your fragrance shouldn't announce to people that you're around, but it should make people remember you.</p>
                    </PostPhotoElaborate>
                </PostPhotoWrapContainer>
                <p>Fragrance should be applied on dry skin and best after taking a shower. When you want to apply fragrance, you should apply it on warm parts of your body. The heat from these areas will make the scent project better. Examples of these warm parts are your chest, neck, wrists, behind the ears and inner elbow.</p>
                        <p>Some mistakes you should avoid are:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Don't spray the fragrance into the air and walk into it, hoping that the mist will fall on you. It's just an easy way to waste valuable fragrance.</li>
                            <li>Don't rub in the fragrance when you apply it. You are basically killing the scent when you do this.</li>
                            <li>Avoid spraying on clothes. Granted the scent lasts longer when applied on your clothes, it also has a chance of staining the fabric. In cases where you might want to wear the item of clothing again with a different fragrance, the scent of the previous fragrance will affect it. Usually, I suggest only applying on clothes if you are layering your outfit (like wearing a jacket) or don't have multiple fragrances.</li>
                        </ul>

                <h3>Men's Fragrance Tips</h3>

                    <PostPhotoElaborate>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Match The Occasion:</b> The scent you wear should match the event you are going to. You should smell as you look. If you're in a suit you should smell like a man in a suit, not a college athlete. If you're going to the beach, you shouldn't smell like the office.</li>
                            <li><b>Go With The Season:</b> Different fragrances were made with different seasons in mind. Summer scents are usually fresh and watery while winter scents are often dark and woody.</li>
                            <li><b>Store Your Fragrances Properly:</b> Store your fragrances in a cool, dark and dry place. Changes in temperature and sunlight can affect the shelf life of the fragrance and in some cases affect the scent.</li>
                            <li><b>Build a Collection:</b> Slowly but surely you should work on acquiring different fragrances to suit your different needs and lifestyle. You can have a signature fragrance but should have alternatives to add variety.</li>
                        </ul>
